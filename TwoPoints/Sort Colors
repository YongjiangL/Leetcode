Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

Solution:
public void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int t = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = t;
    }
    
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int j = nums.length-1;
        int start = 0, end = j;
        while (start <= end) {
            if (nums[end] == 2) {
                swap(nums, j, end);
                j--;
                end--;
            }
            else if (nums[end] == 0) {
                swap(nums, start, end);
                start++;
            }
            else
                end--;
        }
    }
