Given a rows * columns matrix mat of ones and zeros, return how many submatrices have all ones.
Input: mat = [[0,1,1,0],
              [0,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
There are 8 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 5 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x3. 
There are 4 rectangles of side 2x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 2x2. 
There are 2 rectangles of side 3x1. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x2. 
Total number of rectangles = 8 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 24.
Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 21

Solution:
1) consider how to count number of all 1 subvectors. For a subvector in size length with 1, it contains length of different answers.
int numOfOneRow(int[] row) {
        int ans = 0, length = 0;
        for (int v:row) {
            length = (v == 0 ? 0:length+1);
            ans += length;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
2) Now we sovle 2D matrix by finding all 1 submatrix from row up to down, and use the 1D helper function. 
We create an array dp, if dp[k] == 1 means all values in column k from row up to down are all 1 (we use &).
Overall, the idea is compress the 2D array to 1D array, then apply 1D helper function. 
Time complexity: O(M^2*N), space complexity: O(N)
public int numSubmat(int[][] mat) {
        int M = mat.length, N = mat[0].length;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int up = 0; up < M; up++) {
            int[] dp = new int[N];
            Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
            for (int down = up; down < M; down++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) 
                    dp[k] &= mat[down][k];
                ans += numOfOneRow(dp);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    int numOfOneRow(int[] row) {
        int ans = 0, length = 0;
        for (int v:row) {
            length = (v == 0 ? 0:length+1);
            ans += length;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    
3)Optimize O(M * N) by Using Stack
Now in the code, the h[j] means: number of continius 1 in column j from row i up to row 0. By using mono-stack, 
what we want to achieve is to find the first previous index "preIndex", whose number of continuous 1 is less than current column index i. 
And the value of index between preIndex and i are all equal or larger than index i. So it can form a big sub-metrics.
Note: sum[i] means the number of submatrices with the column "i" as the right border.
If stack is empty, meaning: all previous columns has more/equal ones than current column. So, the number of metrics can form is simply A[i] * (i + 1); (0-index)
If stack is not empty, meaning: there is a shorter column which breaks our road. Now, the number of metrics can form is sum[i] += A[i] * (i - preIndex). 
And plus, we can form a longer submetrics with that previou shorter column sum[preIndex].
The best way to understand is to draw a graph.

	return res;

	int[] sum = new int[A.length];
