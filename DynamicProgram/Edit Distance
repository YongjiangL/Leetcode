Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. 
Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.
Insert
Remove
Replace
All of the above operations are of equal cost.

Input:   str1 = "geek", str2 = "gesek"
Output:  1
Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
Output:  1
Input:   str1 = "sunday", str2 = "saturday"
Output:  3

Solution:
The idea is process all characters one by one staring from from left side of both strings.
there are two possibilities for every pair of character being traversed.
m: Length of str1 (first string)
n: Length of str2 (second string)

If last characters of two strings are same, nothing much to do. Ignore last characters and get count for remaining strings. So we recur for lengths m-1 and n-1.
Else (If last characters are not same), we consider all operations on ‘str1’, consider all three operations on last character of first string, recursively compute minimum cost for all three operations and take minimum of three values.
Insert: Recur for m and n-1
Remove: Recur for m-1 and n
Replace: Recur for m-1 and n-1

Time Complexity: O(m x n)
Space: O(m x n)

public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();
        int[][] f = new int[m+1][n+1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
            f[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
            f[0][j] = j;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))
                    f[i][j] = f[i-1][j-1];
                else
                    f[i][j] = Math.min(f[i-1][j-1], Math.min(f[i-1][j], f[i][j-1]))+1;
            }
        
        return f[m][n];
    }
