https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5

Edge cases:
1) list is empty
2) all nodes less than x
3) all nodes greater than x

Solution: Time: O(N), Space: O(1)
We can take two pointers less and great to keep track of the two linked lists. 
These two pointers point to two separate lists and then these lists could be combined to form the desired reformed list.

ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, int x) {
        if (head == NULL) return head;
        ListNode *dump1 = new ListNode(-1), *dump2 = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode* less = dump1, *great = dump2;
        ListNode* p = head;
        while (p) {
            if (p->val < x)
                less->next = p, less = less->next;
            else
                great->next = p, great = great->next;
            p = p->next;
        }
        less->next = dump2->next;
        great->next = NULL;
        return dump1->next;
    }
