https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/
Given a node from a Circular Linked List which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list, 
and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the circular list.
If the list is empty (i.e., given node is null), you should create a new single circular list and 
return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.
Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
Output: [3,4,1,2]
Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
Output: [1,0]
Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
Output: [1]

Edge cases:
1) list is empty
2) list has one element
3) insertVal is less than the minimal or greater than the maximal in list
4) all elements are same in list

Solution:
Node* insert(Node* head, int val) {
        Node* p = head;
        if (p == NULL) {
            head = new Node(val);
            head->next = head;
            return head;
        }
        Node* pre = head;
        p = head->next;
        do {
            if (pre->val <= val && val <= p->val)
                break;
            if (pre->val > p->val) {
              //val is greatest or smallest
                if (val >= pre->val || val <= p->val)
                    break;
            }
            pre = p;
            p = p->next;
        }while (pre != head);
        pre->next = new Node(val, p);
        return head;
    }
