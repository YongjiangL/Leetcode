Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true

Follow up: do it using O(1) memory.
Edge cases:
1) list is empty
2) only 1 node, has a cycle
3) many nodes, one node has a cycle points to itself

Solution: 
Traverse linked list using two pointers. 
Move one pointer(slow) by one and another pointer(fast) by two. 
If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesn’t have a loop
bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (slow && fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast)
                return true;
            
        }
        return false;
    }

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1

Follow up: do it using O(1) memory.
Edge cases:
1) list is empty
2) only 1 node, has a cycle
3) many nodes, one node has a cycle points to itself

Solution:
1) use hashing to detect the first node of loop.
We iterate the whole linked list, and store node in a set one by one. Before we store it, we check if it is in set, if yes, 
then we find the start node.
 ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        unordered_set<ListNode*> us;
        while (head) {
            if (us.count(head))
                return head;
            us.insert(head);
            head = head->next;
        }
        return NULL;
    }

2) Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm
Idea: 
If a loop is found, initialize slow pointer to head, let fast pointer be at its position.
Move both slow and fast pointers one node at a time.
When they meet, it is the start of the loop.
The reason is, assume there is n nodes in loop, m nodes from head to the start of loop, fast is at a node in loop where distance is k to the start of loop.
(m+k) is muliples of n.

 ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == NULL) return NULL;
        ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head;
        while(1) {
            slow = slow->next;
            if (fast && fast->next)
                fast = fast->next->next;
            else
                return NULL;
            if (slow == fast)
                break;
        }
        if (slow != fast) return NULL;
        slow = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
