https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
Return a deep copy of the list.
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Input: head = []
Output: []

Follow-up: use O(1) extra Space.
Edge cases:
Input list is empty
All random pointer is NULL
Some random pointer is not NULL.

Solution: We can use a separate dictionary to keep the old node -> new node mapping, while it's O(N) space.
Idea:
Traverse the original list and clone the nodes as you go and place the cloned copy next to its original node.
cloned.next = original.next
original.next = cloned

Use the original nodes' random pointers to assign references to random pointers for cloned nodes.
cloned->random= original->random->next;

Now restore the original and copy linked lists in this fashion in a single loop.
original->next = original->next->next;
cloned->next = cloned->next->next;

Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (head == NULL)
            return NULL;
        Node* p = head;
        while (p) {
            Node* clone = new Node(p->val);
            clone->next = p->next;
            p->next = clone;
            p = clone->next;
        }
        p = head;
        while (p) {
            Node* clone = p->next;
            clone->random = p->random? p->random->next : NULL;
            p = clone->next;
        }
        //split to two lists
        Node *cloneHead = head->next;
        p = head;
        Node *q = cloneHead;
        while (p && q) {
            p->next = q->next;
            p = p->next;
            q->next = p ? p->next : NULL;
            q = q ? q->next : NULL;
        }
        return cloneHead;
    }

2)
https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

Edge cases:
Graph is empty
All nodes have no neighbors


Solution: BFS
We will use a hash map to store the reference of the copy of all the nodes that have already been visited and copied.
An array visited is used to prevent cycles and get the cloned copy of a node.

 Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if (node == NULL) return NULL;
        unordered_map<int, Node*> dict;
        Node* first = new Node(node->val);
        dict[node->val] = first;
        queue<Node*> que;
        que.push(node);
        while (!que.empty()) {
            Node* cur = que.front();
            Node* copy = dict[cur->val];
            que.pop();
            for (Node* ngh:cur->neighbors) {
                if (dict.count(ngh->val))
                    copy->neighbors.push_back(dict[ngh->val]);
                else {
                    Node* newNgh = new Node(ngh->val);
                    dict[ngh->val] = newNgh;
                    copy->neighbors.push_back(newNgh);
                    que.push(ngh);
                }
            }
        }
