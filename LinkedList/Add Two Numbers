1. https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order 
and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

Solution:
Traverse both lists and One by one pick nodes of both lists and add the values. 
If the sum is more than 10 then make carry as 1 and reduce sum. 
If one list has more elements, then consider remaining values of another list as 0.
Time: O(n+m)
Space: O(1)


2. https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/
The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7

Edge cases:
1) Both lists are empty
2) One list is empty

Requirement: Space complexity is O(1)
Solution:
Reverse both lists, add the nodes of both lists iteratively, then reverse the resultant list.

ListNode* reverse(ListNode* node, ListNode* pre) {
        if (node == NULL) return NULL;
        ListNode* next = node;
        if (node->next) next = reverse(node->next, node);
        node->next = pre;
        return next;
    }
    
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        if (l1 == NULL) return l2;
        if (l2 == NULL) return l1;
        l1 = reverse(l1, NULL), l2 = reverse(l2, NULL);
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode* dump = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode* p = dump;
        while (l1 || l2) {
            int v1 = 0;
            if (l1) v1 = l1->val, l1 = l1->next;
            int v2 = 0;
            if (l2) v2 = l2->val, l2 = l2->next;
            int sum = v1 + v2 + carry;
            p->next = new ListNode(sum%10);
            carry = sum/10;
            p = p->next;
        }
        if (carry) p->next = new ListNode(carry);
        return reverse(dump->next, NULL);
    }
