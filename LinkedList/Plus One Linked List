Given a non-negative integer represented as non-empty a singly linked list of digits, plus one to the integer.
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]

Follow up: do it in O(N) time, O(1) space
Edge cases:
1) list is empty
2) all digit is 9

Solution:
Identify the rightmost digit which is not equal to nine and increase that digit by one.
Increase that digit by one. Set all the following nines to zero.
We create a sentinel node for the leftmost digit.

ListNode* plusOne(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) return head;
        ListNode* dump = new ListNode(0);
        dump->next = head;
        ListNode* p = dump, *nonNine = NULL;
        while (p) {
            if (p->val != 9) nonNine = p;
            p = p->next;
        }
        nonNine->val += 1;
        p = nonNine->next;
        while (p) {
            p->val = 0;
            p = p->next;
        }
        return dump->val != 0 ? dump:dump->next;
    }
