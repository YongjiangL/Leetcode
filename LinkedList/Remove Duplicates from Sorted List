https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.
Input: 1->1->2->3->3
Output: 1->2->3

Solution: Time: O(N), Space: O(1)
Traverse the list from the head node. 
While traversing, compare each node with its next node. If data of next node is same as current node, ignore it, 
and we need to store next pointer of the node.

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/
Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.
Return the linked list sorted as well.
Input: 1->2->3->3->4->4->5
Output: 1->2->5

Edge cases:
1) List is empty
2) All elements are duplicate
3) No element is duplicate

Solution: Time: O(N), Space: O(1)
The idea is to maintain a pointer (prev) to the node which just previous to the block of nodes we are checking for duplicates.
ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dump = new ListNode(-1);
        dump->next = head;
        ListNode* pre = dump;
        ListNode* cur = head;
        while (cur) {
            while (cur->next && pre->next->val == cur->next->val)
                cur = cur->next;
            if (pre->next == cur)
                pre = pre->next;
            else
                pre->next = cur->next;
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        return dump->next;
    }
