Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.
Input: 4->2->1->3
Output: 1->2->3->4

Solution: QuickSort
In partition(), we consider last element as pivot. 
We vist the current list and if a node has value greater than pivot, we move it after tail. 
If the node has smaller value, we keep it at its current position.
In QuickSort, we first call partition() which places pivot at correct position and returns pivot. 
After pivot is placed at correct position, we find tail node of left side (list before pivot) and recur for left list. 
Finally, we recur for right list.
