https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.
Input: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
Outpt: 1->2->3->5.

Requirement: Do it in one pass, Time: O(N), Space: O(1)

Edge cases:
1) n is nagative
2) elements in list is less than n
3) list is empty
4) the n-th node is the first node from the beginning.

Solution:
Take two pointers, p point to the head of the linked list and q point to the Nth node from the beginning.
Now keep increment both the pointers by one at the same time until q is pointing to the last node.
After that, p should be pointing to the Nth node from the end by now. So, delete the node where p is pointing to.

 ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        if (head == NULL)
            return NULL;
        ListNode *p = head;
        ListNode *q = head;
        int c = 0;
        while (c < n) {
            if (q->next == NULL) {
                if (c == n-1)
                    head = head->next;
                return head;
            }
            q = q->next;
            c++;
        }
        while (q->next) {
            p = p->next;
            q = q->next;
        }
        p->next = p->next->next;
        if (head == NULL)
            head = p;
        return head;
    }
