https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 
11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.
The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  
For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.
For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.

Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.

Input: 10
Output: 5

Solution:
Construct 1-bits bitmask and flip all the bits at once.
There are many ways to do it, let's start from the simplest one:

Compute bit length of the input number l = [\log_2{num}] + 1
Compute 1-bits bitmask of length ll: bitmask=(1<<l)−1.
Return num ^ bitmask.

 public int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
        int l = (int)(Math.log(N)/Math.log(2)) + 1;
        int mask = (1 << l) - 1;
        return mask^N;
    }
