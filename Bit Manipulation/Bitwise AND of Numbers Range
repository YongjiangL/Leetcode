Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0

Solution:
first we could represent each number in the range in its binary form which we could view as a string of binary numbers.
after the AND operation on all the numbers, the remaining part of bit strings is the common prefix of all these bit strings.
More specifically, the common prefix of all these bit string is also the common prefix between the starting and ending numbers of the specified range.

The idea is that we shift both numbers to the right, until the numbers become equal.
Then we append zeros to the common prefix in order to obtain the desired result, by shifting the common prefix to the left.

Time: O(N), Space: O(N)
int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        int shift = 0;
        //find the common 1-bits
        while (m < n) {
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            shift++;
        }
        return m << shift;
    }
