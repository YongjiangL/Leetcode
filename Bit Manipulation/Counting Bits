Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]

Solution:
x has the same num of 1s as x/2 + 1, if x is odd

 public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] arr = new int[num+1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) 
            arr[i] = arr[i/2] + i%2;      
        return arr;
    }
