Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and 
returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards)
for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.
For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], 
then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

Example
Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]


Solution:
You can refer to the same problem 739. Daily Temperatures.
Push every pair of <price, result> to a stack.
Pop lower price from the stack and accumulate the count.

One price will be pushed once and popped once.
So 2 * N times stack operations and N times calls.
I'll say time complexity is amortized O(1)

class StockSpanner {
    public Stack<int[]> sk;
    
    public StockSpanner() {
        sk = new Stack<int[]>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        int res = 1;
        while (!sk.empty() && sk.peek()[0] <= price)
            res += sk.pop()[1];
        sk.add(new int[]{price, res});
        return res;
    }
}
