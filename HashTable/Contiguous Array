Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Solution:
We make use of a HashMap mapmap to store the entries in the form of (index, count)(index,count). 
We make an entry for a countcount in the mapmap whenever the countcount is encountered first, 
and later on use the correspoding index to find the length of the largest subarray with equal no. of zeros and
ones when the same countcount is encountered again.

public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2)
            return 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int count = 0, len = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            count += (nums[i] == 1)? 1:-1;
            if (count == 0)
                len = Math.max(len, i+1);
            if (map.containsKey(count))
                len = Math.max(len, i - map.get(count));
            else
                map.put(count, i);
        }
        return len;
    }
